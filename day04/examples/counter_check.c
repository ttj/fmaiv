/* CBMC harness for the counter from counter.c.
 *
 * We unwind the step function up to N times. At each step we let CBMC
 * choose a nondeterministic press input (this is what `nondet_bool()`
 * does — CBMC treats it as a fresh, unconstrained boolean). After every
 * step we assert the invariant that nuXmv and Lean confirmed:
 *      x <= COUNT_MAX
 *
 * Build and verify:
 *
 *      cbmc counter.c counter_check.c --unwind 26 --unwinding-assertions
 *
 * Expected verdict:  VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
 *
 * Try also:
 *      cbmc counter.c counter_check.c --unwind 6     (still ok; covers a shorter
 *                                                     trace -- BOUND-1 iterations)
 *      cbmc counter.c counter_check.c --trace        (shows a successful path)
 *
 * Note: --unwind needs BOUND+1, not BOUND. CBMC unwinds the body BOUND
 * times and then adds one more check confirming the loop has terminated.
 * The "+1" is for that termination check.
 *
 * To see a failed verification, change `<= COUNT_MAX` to `< COUNT_MAX`
 * below and re-run. CBMC will print a counterexample path that pushes
 * x to exactly COUNT_MAX.
